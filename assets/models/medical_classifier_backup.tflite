This is a placeholder for a TensorFlow Lite medical classification model.
In a real implementation, this would be a binary .tflite file trained on medical data.
The model should have:
- Input shape: [1, 10000] (bag-of-words features)
- Output shape: [1, 12] (12 medical categories)
- Supported operations for medical text classification
